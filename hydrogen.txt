Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. Hydrogen is the lightest element. 
At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. 
It is colorless, odorless, tasteless,[8] non-toxic, and highly combustible. 
Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter.
Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. 
Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. 
For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.

Now, let's talk about oxygen:

Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. 
It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. 
Oxygen is Earth's most abundant element, and after hydrogen and helium, it is the third-most abundant element in the universe. 
At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. 
Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time. 
Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of oxides.
